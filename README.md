Learn Laravel
================================

A website to help you to learn Laravel framework.  

You can visit it via [https://learn-laravel.fenz.land](https://learn-laravel.fenz.land). 

--------------------------------

This is not another manual or documentation of Laravel. We not talk about how to use, but about how to understanding. 

For each article, we will take a section and explore how it works. During this, we will quote codes from application or framework inside. 
So, please prepare to read the source codes of Laravel. Trust me, they are extremely beautiful. 
You will enjoy them and learn a lot from them. 

Besides, we will add some best practices for you. If you are face to the same situation, that will be helpful. 

This project itself is a live example. You can find the best practices that we talk about in it. 

We also make a summing up at the last for each article. We'll list the related knowledge points. 
You can make deeper learning with them by reading source code or official documentations. 

If you are completely novice of Laravel, maybe you need to read [Official Documentations](https://laravel.com/docs) first. 
Even if you are seasoned veteran, official documentations also help you to prevent from out of date. 

Happy learning!
